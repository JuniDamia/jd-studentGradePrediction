# 🏫 Student Grade Prediction

This web application predicts a student's **Final Grade** based on multiple academic and behavioural factors.  
It uses a **Linear Regression model (80:20 split)** trained on a cleaned student performance dataset.

The app is built using **Streamlit**, allowing users to input features and instantly get predicted student performance.
